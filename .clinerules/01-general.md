# General Project Rules

- Use the main language/framework of the project consistently.
- Do not edit generated folders (dist/, build/, .output/, etc.).
- Keep source code and configuration organised and documented.
- Keep external dependencies minimal and justified.
- Avoid unsafe practices (eval, hardcoded secrets, inline scripts).
- Follow framework/language security best practices.
